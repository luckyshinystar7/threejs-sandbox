# Fat Lines with Clean Transparency

An approach rendering the three.js fat lines with transparency using two passes, depth writing, and the stencil buffer. Options are provided to toggle both stencil and depth writing.

If depth is disabled and stencil enable the line overlaps in incorrect ways. If this look is acceptable then it can be achieved in a single pass but the stencil buffer must be cleared afterward.

If stencil is disabled and depth enabled then overlap artifacts are present.

An alpha-to-coverage approach can also be enabled which switches the line to use a single pass and no stencil or depth tricks. Instead the alpha to coverage features are used to provide multiple bins of transparency. This only works when anti aliasing is enabled and limits the ability to use anti aliasing on the line itself.

**TODO**

- Try cutting out an inverted circle on the negative side of the lines to make "room" for the positive side endcap circle and they won't overlap.
