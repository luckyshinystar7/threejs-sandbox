# Valve File Loaders

A small effort to try to decode and load valve 3d file formats. The formats are not very well-documented and only texture loading has been implemented.

## Formats

- [X] **VTF** https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Valve_Texture_Format
  - Texture Format
- [ ] **VMT** https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Material
  - Material Format
- [ ] **VTX** https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/VTX
  - Per-target optimized representations of vertex indices (?)
- [ ] **VVD** https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/VVD
  - Bone, normal, vertex, attribute information
- [ ] **PHY** https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/PHY
  - Physics and ragdoll information
- [ ] **MDL** https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/MDL
  - The high level information for defining the structure of a model
