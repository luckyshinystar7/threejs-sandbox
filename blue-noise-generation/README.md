# Blue Noise Generation

_In Progress_

Class for generating blue noise textures and example for generating monochrome or RGB variations.

## TODO

- Optimizations
	- track min and max scores for min and maj points so you don't have to search every time.
- Validate algorithm
- Check radius approach -- see if it creates overly repetitious patterns
- Allow for displaying the initial binary pattern.
