# Conditional Lines

## TODO
- Add helper to generate edges geometry by only creating lines on non-merged edges after calling `BufferGeometryUtils.mergeVertices`.
- Add helper for generating conditional lines, add shader
- Add toggles for four modes (both line approaches with and without conditional lines)
