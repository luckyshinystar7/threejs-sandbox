# Perspective Fat Lines

A modification of the Line2 example that adds support for perspective attenuated lines to the material definition by setting `material.worldUnits = true`.

Demo [here](https://gkjohnson.github.io/threejs-sandbox/perspective-fat-lines/webgl_lines_fat.html)!

This was added into three.js in [PR #16912](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/pull/16912).
