# Sobel Outline

Sobel outline postprocessing that uses normal and depth buffers based on technique outlined [here](https://www.vertexfragment.com/ramblings/unity-postprocessing-sobel-outline/#normal-based-outline).

## Possible Improvements

- Take more samples to avoid disconnected outlines.
- Expose exponent to control outline cutoff.
