# Screen-Space Reflections Render Pass

A rough screen space reflections implementation based on [Morgan McGuire's screen space ray tracing article](http://casual-effects.blogspot.com/2014/08/screen-space-ray-tracing.html) and [Kode80's Unity SSRR implementation](https://github.com/kode80/kode80SSR).

[Demo here!](https://gkjohnson.github.io/threejs-sandbox/screenSpaceReflectionsPass/)

## TODO
- Add blur based on roughness
- Support animations, normal, and roughness maps
- Add z fade
- Add controls
- Improve the connected-ness of the reflections to the ground
