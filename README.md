# threejs-sandbox

Set of experiments and extensions to THREE.js intended to eventually be contributed to the core library, examples folder, or moved into their own repo.

## Project Ideas
- Pin designer / visualizer
  - JSClipper may be relevant: https://github.com/Delapouite/JsClipper
- High quality product rendering with jittered light, soft shadows, refraction, etc
- 3D model diff
- Translucent object rendering (rendering back faces with depth buffer)
- 3D flow lines
- Ground Truth SSAO
- Horizon Based AO
- Temporal Filtering
- Command line model conversion tool
- Velocity Buffer Pass
- 3D LUT Tone Mapping
- Water-tight geometry detection using solid angles (https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/1205927/how-to-calculate-the-area-covered-by-any-spherical-rectangle)
- 3D Bin Packing Algorithm
- Separate velocity buffer
- Subsurface Scattering and Transparency / glass
- GPU Particles
- voxel-based global illumination
- light probes-based GI
