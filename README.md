# threejs-sandbox

Set of experiments and extensions to THREE.js intended to eventually be contributed to the core library, examples folder, or moved into their own repo.

## Potential Projects

- Deferred Renderer
- Translucent material with refraction, diffusion, depth peeling
  - gem refraction ([link 1](https://www.shadertoy.com/view/ltfXDM), [link 2](https://github.com/amsXYZ/three-multifaceted-refraction))
- TRAA, non float buffer on volume-lights ([see playdead implementation](https://github.com/playdeadgames/temporal/blob/master/GDC2016_Temporal_Reprojection_AA_INSIDE.pdf))

- use GLSL syntax parser for debugger
- Blue Noise Dithering
- [VXGI](https://wickedengine.net/2017/08/30/voxel-based-global-illumination/)
- Subsurface Scattering
- SSDO
- Terrain authoring system (https://github.com/simondevyoutube/ProceduralTerrain_Part5)

**NEXT**
- SSRR
- Lens distortion, film noise, lens chromatic aberration
- 3D LUT
